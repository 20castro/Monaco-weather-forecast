	abstract = {Weather forecast is a crucial input for prediction of local building consumption and power production profiles in the building's microgrid. E.g., prediction of solar irradiance components and air temperature is used to predict photovoltaic array power production, while air temperature and humidity are often used to predict building consumption during the day. Due to the computation complexity of meteorological models, new prediction sequence becomes available every 6 h at best, and often comes with a nearly 4 h lag. In this paper we develop a linear and nonlinear corrector models to improve weather forecast by using local measurements only. The main motivation behind this approach is to correct prediction sequence by using local measurements as they become available, i.e. prediction sequence is refreshed every 1 h instead of every 6 h. The proposed approach is validated on historical air temperature prediction sequences and actual measurements during 6 months period.},

	abstract = {As a promising area in machine learning, multi-task learning ({MTL}) aims to improve the performance of multiple related learning tasks by leveraging useful information among them. In this paper, we give an overview of {MTL} by first giving a definition of {MTL}. Then several different settings of {MTL} are introduced, including multi-task supervised learning, multi-task unsupervised learning, multi-task semi-supervised learning, multi-task active learning, multi-task reinforcement learning, multi-task online learning and multi-task multi-view learning. For each setting, representative {MTL} models are presented. In order to speed up the learning process, parallel and distributed {MTL} models are introduced. Many areas, including computer vision, bioinformatics, health informatics, speech, natural language processing, web applications and ubiquitous computing, use {MTL} to improve the performance of the applications involved and some representative works are reviewed. Finally, recent theoretical analyses for {MTL} are presented.},

	abstract = {Short-term solar irradiance forecasting is crucial in managing power network operations and solar photovoltaic applications. In this paper, a Multi-view Deep Forecasting method with Error Correction ({MvDF}\_EC) for 1-hour ahead solar forecasting is proposed. {MvDF}\_EC comprises of the Multi-view Deep Forecasting method ({MvDF}) and a robust Radial Basis Function Neural Network trained via minimizing the Localized Generalization Error for compensating the solar forecasting error of {MvDF}. {MvDF} consists of three deep neural networks which learn representations of input data from different views. The three views are 1) the hierarchical local temporal information extracted by the Temporal Convolutional Neural Network ({TCN}), 2) the key context sequential information captured by the Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory Neural Network with Temporal Attention ({BLSTMattn}), and 3) long-term temporal dependencies between local temporal patterns filtered by the Convolutional Gated Recurrent Unit Neural Network (C\_GRU). The solar forecasting performance of the proposed {MvDF}\_EC is evaluated with the National Solar Radiation Database. Simulation results show that {MvDF}\_EC yields the most accurate solar prediction compared with the benchmarks including the smart persistence and the state-of-the-art models. The lowest relative Root Mean Square Error values for Maraba and Labelle are 22.08\% and 27.40\%, respectively in 1-hour ahead solar forecasting.},

	abstract = {Abstract This study addresses the issue of improving nowcasting accuracy by integrating several numerical weather prediction ({NWP}) model forecasts with observation data. To derive the best algorithms for generating integrated forecasts, different integration methods were applied starting with integrating the {NWP} models using equal weighting. Various refinements are then successively applied including dynamic weighting, variational bias correction, adjusted dynamic weighting, and constraints using current observation data. Three {NWP} models—the Canadian Global Environmental Multiscale ({GEM}) regional model, the {GEM} Limited Area Model ({LAM}), and the American Rapid Update Cycle ({RUC}) model—are used to generate the integrated forecasts. Verification is performed at two Canadian airport locations [Toronto International Airport ({CYYZ}), in Ontario, and Vancouver International Airport ({CYVR}), in British Columbia] over the winter and summer seasons. The results from the verification for four weather variables (temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed and gust) clearly show that the integrated models with new refinements almost always perform better than each of the {NWP} models individually and collectively. When the integrated model with innovative dynamic weighting and variational bias correction is further updated with the most current observation data, its performance is the best among all models, for all the selected variables regardless of location and season. The results of this study justify the use of integrated {NWP} forecasts for nowcasting provided they are properly integrated using appropriate and specifically designed rules and algorithms.},
